<b>Economic Analyst</b></div>



<p>This study was performed as part of a course on large scale power generation systems. The plant design was developed in response to an RFI regarding technological solutions for reducing GHG emissions in Canadian power generation.

<p>The plant consists of a nominal 200 MW of deep water wind turbines located near the tri-provincial border of Newfoundland, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. By rehabilitating existing offshore oil infrastructure and taking advantage of the newly constructed 500 MW Maritime link, power could be provided to poorly-serviced communities throughout the region. </p>


<p>To determine the economic feasibility of the project, estimations of capital and operational costs were produced and analyzed using Excel and RETScreen. Assuptions were made regarding financing parameters including debt fraction, interest rates, electricity price escalation, etc.  </p>

<p>The cumulative cash flow diagram above represents the best case scenario for the project. Despite the apparent payback period of ~15 years, the analysis produces a negative NPV, indicating that the project is not feasible without government subsidization. However, market research indicates that offshore wind costs are falling, and Canadian wind generation is eligible for both direct and indirect incentives. </p>
