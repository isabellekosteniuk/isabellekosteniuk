<h3>Internal Service Catalogue</h3> <br>
<b><div style="text-align:center">Front-End Developer</div></b>

<p>A service catalogue for internal office use where no web server is available. The site is an entirely client-side SPA and was built using Angular. The site can be stored on a network drive and accessed using an index shortcut.</p>

<p>The site uses a heirarchical controller structure to maintain modularity, with catalogue items and other site data stored in controller-accessible hashes. UI design features include a collapsable navigation bar and responsive content. The needs of various departments were integrated in order to provide a clean interface for employees to access services. </p>
