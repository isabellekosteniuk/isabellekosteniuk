The purpose of this project was to design a three-level townhouse designed for Ottawa that could achieve net-zero or better energy use. The design considered the building envelope, passive/active energy systems, material selection for environmental impact, occupant behaviour, and conforms to ASHRAE standards. The figure below illustrates the results of the project, including main metrics such as energy intensity per occupant and net energy production.

The HVAC system was developed iteratively using HOT2000 and EnergyPlus weather data. Notable HVAC features include a ground-source heat pump using HRV & drain heat recovery unit, both suitable to cold climates and small residential lots. Radiant in-floor heating was selected as the primary heat distribution system due to the high efficiency and comfort provided. Forced-air was selected as the most feasible cooling solution for the space. To achieve net-zero energy use, the HVAC system was closely integrated with the building envelope in order to minimize the amount of space heating/cooling required.
