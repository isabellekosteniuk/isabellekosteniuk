This project is a state-of-the-art research facility in which several independent methods of sustainable solar thermal domestic heating and cooling will be tested over the next several decades. A multidisciplinary team of professors, graduate students, and technicians manage the facilities and conduct experiments as part of the Carleton University Substainable Building Energy Systems group.

Commissioning the data acquisition and control system involved physical installation of sensors and controllers as well as the development of a software-based control system. The control system consisted of National Instruments PXI controllers and modules, using a Mac supervisor machine. The system was responsible for coordinating information flow between flowmeters, wind sensors, pyranometers, actuated valves, and several hundred thermocouples located throughout the three-story building.

<p>
The data acquisition and control software, written mainly in LabVIEW was responsible for the following:
<ul>
<li>Read data - communicate with variety of sensors with different ranges, noise levels, and output types. </li>
<li>Manipulate data - pipeline moderately large amounts of data through calibration polynomials. </li>
<li>Store data - create formatting system for easily readable data and transfer files regularly to a remote SVN server</li>
<li>Make control decisions - Use relays to change heating/cooling modes based on sensor output</li>
</ul><br>

The system is currently able to operate autonomously and maintain the house at a comfortable temperature. The following infographic showcases several experiments being conducted as well as main features of the facility.
