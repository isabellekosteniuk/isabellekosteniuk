Installed instrumentation - custom thermopiles, flowmeters, wind sensors, pyranometers. Interpretation of technical documents and manuals. Mechanical, electrical connections. Cabling layouts and information management. 

Labview stuff. Worked with National Instruments data acquisition controllers. Built off existing project.

Tasks to read data - communicate with variety of sensors with different ranges, noise levels, output types. 
Manipulate data - pipeline moderately large amounts f data through calibration polynomials. 
Store data - create formatting system for easily readable data
Make decisions (change modes) - translate control algorithm to labview 
Actuate sensors - relays, lots of string manipulation

Send data to SVN server for processing and storage using PowerShell script.

Worked with a team of graduate students and technicians.
