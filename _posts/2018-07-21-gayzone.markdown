<h3>Gayzone</h3> <br>
<b><div style="text-align:center">Full Stack Developer</div></b>

<p>A Django-based site built as a response to a local health clinic's RFP</p> 

<p>Django was chosen to streamline the development of both the client-facing site and an administrative backend for clinic nurses to maintain. The site was proposed to replace an outdated web page and provide a contemporary online space for clinic users to stay up-to-date with sexual health information and events. Hosted by pythonanywhere.com.</p>

<p>See the site here <a href="http://isabellekosteniuk.pythonanywhere.com/">here.</a></p>
